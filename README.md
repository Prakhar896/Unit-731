This is an informative website detailing the human atrocities and aftermath of Unit 731, a unit of the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. [See it here.](https://prakhar896.github.io/Unit-731)

The words "informative website" feel a little reductive when it comes to the purpose and contents of the website; it takes the user on a journey through the events of Unit 731 and also explains its double-edged outcome, which might surprise many.

As detailed in **Why this site?** on the website itself, I made the website because I was surprised by the double-edged outcome of Unit 731, a downright inhumane piece of history. Despite its activities, it also had some positive outcomes; this shifted my perspective on things from being black-and-white to a more neutral POV.

Thus, I made this website which tells a didactic story of Unit 731.

The website contains 4 main sections:
- **Home & Prologue:** Introduces Unit 731 and sets up The Journey in an intriguing manner.
- **The Journey:** Consists of 3 chapters (namely Zhongma Fortress, Escape and Expansion and The End and Epilogue) that briefly takes the user through Unit 731's story.
- **Why this site?:** Details my intention behind making the site.
- **About & Feedback:** I introduce myself to the viewer here. This page also contains a fully functioning feedback form where the viewer submits their feedback. Viewers receive an email confirming the feedback's reception. The email also thanks them for visiting the site.
